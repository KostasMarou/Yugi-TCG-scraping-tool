This is the short version of the price scraping tool for card games.
Please email me for the larger version if you would be interested in collaborating.
I have made the tool also for the Power Automate Desktop version which is not detectable by CAPTCHA.


In this version please adjust the paths to reflect the correct path to the files.
Keep in ming that we search only the first 10 cards from the full yugioh list (which is already scraped and provided for your convenience - scrape on 10-10-2024)

This is a project which is still in progress, created for my friend Bill who had the inspiration for this project.
